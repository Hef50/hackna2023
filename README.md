# MotivMate | HackNA 2023
Haresh Muralidharan and Rushil Surti’s 2023 HackNA project: MotivMate.

## Mission

There are so many apps and website to track your fitness goals, but none that truly engage a community and build tight-knit bonds between groups of people with the same interests. That's why we set out on a mission to fill this niche with an all-inclusive community fitness platform to reach all our fitness goals. Working out alone is one thing, but people are way more likely (40% more to be precise) to continue working out when they have loving and supporting community to help them reach it. That's why we created this platform for everyday people to find communities who share similar interests to them and with whom they can tackle fun and exciting challenges. We also provided a bunch of resources as well as an AI coaching assistant to help you on your way!

## Pitch

MotivMate is a website designed with the idea in mind to combat all the modern distractions that keep you away nutrition and fitness with the power of working together with friends in an **engaging community,** keeping you motivated. We hope that MotivMate will inspire you and your community to get together, all differences aside, and just truly enjoy each other’s company while getting healthier, happier, and stronger.

## Navigating

While obviously not the entire real-grade product, with the time given, we’ve tried to model our website in a way that feels and acts like a real website. MotivMate offers several resources and features that can all be accessed from the top navigation bar. In addition, the home page goes into detail about these features and why we made the website. Keep in mind that you might need to sign in to access all of the features.
